# FlexieTTS

A simple application utilizing IBM Watson's API capabilities to create a realistic TTS (Text-to-Speech) for use in various online applications. This is meant as an accessibility tool for those who are unable to speak and also selective mutes.

# Future Scope

* I would like to implement FlexieTTS to automatically work with your input and output devices so that you can hear and output the TTS to your input devices without needing external applications such as Visual Audio Cable or VoiceMeter.
